# de-scoreboard-app

A score-keeping web-app !
This project was inspired by one of Colt Steele's code-along lessons in his JS tutorial.
I thought taking the tutorial further would do a lot of help to me and other people.

It's been a long while since I edited this readme. Well, things have been happening in the background. A modal where players can input their usernames have been attached (In the manual two player mode tho, lol ). I'm looking out for more and more improvements. Remember, little drops of water make a mighty ocean !. Thanks and see you later
